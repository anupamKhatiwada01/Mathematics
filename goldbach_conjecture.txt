Goldbach's conjecture states that every even integer greater than or equal to two is a sum of two primes. Eg. 4=2+3,6=3+3,20=13+7
The conjecture holds for all numbers upto 10^16. Today we know that every even integer is the sum of atmost 6 primes.


The above conjecture has not been proved but in the realms of computation is very useful. We can constrain ourselves to numbers below 10^16
(Which is a really big number!) and work under the assumption that every even number can be expressed as a sum of two prime numbers.

Is there a way to find these numbers?

a+b=2*n, where a and b are two prime numbers.


I personally cant seem to find these numbers myself with the given information. We can maybe design fun amateur cryptosystems using this information.

Obviously it will not be production grade but we can have some fun and learn a bit more in the process.

How can we design this system?

What information do we have?
1. One even number,n >= 2
2. Two prime numbers,a and b
3. The relation a+b=n,for all n<=10^16


If we know the even number and one of the primes how long will it take us to find the other prime?
How long will it take us to find both the primes?


How many bits will be required to store 10^16?
Not very many.

Turns out finding the two prime numbers is a well documented leetcode question. We'll learn more about it in the algorithms class.
