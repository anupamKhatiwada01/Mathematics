Proposition:
Suppose a,b lies in the set of real numbers then there exists x and y which belong to the set of integers such that ax+by=gcd(a,b).


One really insane thing that we can notice regarding all combinations of ax+by is that all values of ax+by are a multiple of gcd ie.

ax+by = n . gcd(a,b) where n belongs to the set of integers and ax+by>0

let p = gcd(a,b);

a%p==0 && b%p==0

p.t.x+p.q.y
p(tx+qy)

ie ax+by is divisable by gcd for any values of a and b belonging to set of integers.

Thus all combinations of ax+by are a multiple of gcd for x and y larger than 0.

We need to prove that gcd is the smallest linear combination of a and b.
