Suppose we have water jugs with capacity a and b where a<=b. The state of the system is 
described below with a pair of numbers (x,y) where x is the amout of water in jug a and 
y is the amount of water in jug b. Initially both the jugs are empty ie.

(0,0)
(a,0) fill a
(0,a) pour a into b
(a,a) fill a again
(2a-b,b) fill b
(2a-b,0) empty b 
(0,2a-b) pour a in b 
(a,2a-b) fill a again 
(2b-2a,b) pour a in b 
(2b-2a,0) empty b 
(0,2b-2a) pour a into b 
(a,2b-2a) fill a 
(2a-b,b)

We make an observation that at each step both x and y are of the form aX+bY.
That is the amount of water in both jugs at any time is of linear form with a and b.
We need to prove the above statement.

Let's approach this with induction

Base case: x=0 and y=0 then x=y=a.0+b.0 thus applicable
Inductive assumption: Let's assume it is true for random x and y ie. x=aX+bY and y=aM+bN
after n cases. we need to prove it for the n+1 case.

After n cases we have a linear combination of a and b in both the containers.

What are the possible things that could happen in the (n+1)th case?
1. We could empty one of the two containers. In this case the amount of water in the 
   containers would be a linear combination of a and b so this satisfies our requirement.
2. We could fill the larger container with the contents of the smaller container.

    x=aM+bN 
    y=aI+bJ
    If we pour the contents of x into y one of two things happens.
    1. b gets full in which case we stop pouring. Thus y=b and x=aM+bN-(b-(aI+bJ)) both of 
        which are linear functions of a and b.
    2. b does not become full and a gets empty
        x=0 and y=aI+bJ+aM+bN=a(I+M)+b(J+N) both of which are linear functions of a and b.
Thus in all possible cases the function is satisfied. Thus we can say it is true.
