How would you show that not every number of the form N = (p1 路 p2 路 p3 路 . . . 路 pn) + 1 is prime,
where p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn, . . . is the list of all prime numbers?



How to prove the above statement?

We know only one method of approching proofs that is the inductive method. Let's try with that.


N=(p1.p2.p3....pn)+1 is not prime. This is what we have to prove.
We need to prove it for just one case where this will not be prime.

N-1=  p1 *  p2 * .... *pn this is the prime factorization of N-1. This obviously is not prime.
Lots of cases of adding 1 to this will be prime as we can see from observation but we need to prove that atleast 
one of the cases will be composite.


The parity of N-1 is the deciding factor here. If N-1 is even which will only be the case if 2 is in the set of {p1,p2,p3,.,pn} then N will be odd so it is a candidate for being prime otherwise N will be even which will obviously not be prime.

That solves our necessity.
