Let's now work with some gcd.

The greatest common divisor of a and b is the largest number that divides both a and b.

The gcd turns out to be a very valuable piece of information about the relationship between a and b 
and for reasoning about integers in general.

Woahla!!

The below statement is very profound.

The gdc of a and b is the smallest possible linear combination of a and b!!!!

Which also means that there is no other linear combination of a and b which results in a smaller
integer value.

aX+bY>=gcd(a,b);

We need to prove the above statement.


Linear Combinations of GCD

The below theorem is a very important theorem regarding the gcd of two numbers. This unlike most theorems should be remembered.

Theorem 4.2.1: The gcd(a,b)>= aX+bY, ie. the gcd of a and b is the smallest linear combination of a and b.

For eg the gcd(52,44) = 4 and sure enough 4 is the smallest linear combination of 52 and 44 because 6*52+(-7)*44 = 4.

We need to prove the above statement which is very intersting.


Proof of theorem 4.2.1: By the well ordering principle there is a smallest possible combination of a and b call it m.
We'll prove that m=gcd(a,b) by showing both gcd(a,b)<=m and m<=gcd(a,b)


First we'll show that gcd(a,b)<=m.
Let c be any common divisor of a and b such that c|a and c|b.
Therefore c|sa+tb for any s and t

a=k.c
sa= skc

b=l.c
tb=tlc

c|tlc+skc
c|c(tl+sk)

So there is some c which divides sa+tb for any s and t.

The gcd(a,b) is by definition a divisor of both a and b. So gcd(a,b) | sa+tb.
So gcd(a,b) | m as m|sa+tb
hence gcd(a,b)<=m

Now we show that m<=gcd(a,b)
We show this by showing that m | a.

A symmetric argument would show that m | b which means m is a common divisor of a and b.
All that remains is to show that m | a.

The core of our proof lies in showing that m | a.

By division "algorithm"

a=qm+r where 0<=r<m


m=sa+tb

a=q(sa+tb)+r

r=a-q(sa+tb)
r=a-qsa-qtb
r=a(1-qs)+(-qt)b

We just expressed r as a linear combination of a and b.
But m is the smallest linear combination of a and b and 0<=r<m.

As r cannot be smaller than m and positive that means that r=0. This implies m | a.



Corollary 4.2.2: An integer is a linear combination of a and b iff it is a multiple of gcd(a,b).
Proof: We have shown above that every linear combination of a and b is a multiple of gcd.
        Conversely since gcd(a,b) is a linear combination of a and b every multiple of gcd as well.
        gcd(a,b) = sa+tb
        k.gcd(a,b) = k.(sa+tb) = ks.a+kt.b ie every multiple of gcd is also a linear combination of a and b.
        

We can now restate the water jugs lemma in terms of gcd.

Corollary 4.2.3: Suppose we have water jugs with capacities a and b. Then the amout of water in the two jugs is a multiple of the gcd.

For example there is no way to form 4 gallons using 3 and 6 gallons because 4 is not a multiple of gcd(3,6)=3.


Properties of the gcd:

Lemma 4.2.4: The below facts about the gcd hold
1. Every common divisor of a and b divides the gcd(a,b).
    
    c | a and c | b ie c | sa+tb ie sa+tb = k.c
    gcd(a,b) = sa+tb 
    kc = gcd(a,b) ie c | gcd(a,b)

    Every common divisor of a,b divides the gcd


****************************** Maybe think more about the below problem ******************************

    Can we find the next common divisor which we know obviously will be smaller then the gcd.

    Let the next common divisor be x.
    
    x<gcd(a,b)  and x | gcd(a,b)

    ie. gcd(a,b)=m.x

******************************************************************************************************
    
  The above result is not very "obvious" ie we can't really visualize it in our mind. It will be very helpful     to learn tools which break down the visualizations.

2. gcd(ka,kb)=k.gcd(a,b) for all k>0

*************** Proof attempt for the above relation ****************************************************
  
   let m=gcd(ka,kb)
   m | ka and m | kb
   ka = m.x
   kb = m.y

   let gcd(a,b)=n
   a=n.p
   b=n.q

   k.np = m.x
ie.(p/x).n.k = m

Let's approach this in a different manner

We have learnt a couple of neat tricks we can use to approach a gcd problem

Firstly we can take two numbers a and b and go about representing their linear combination as the gcd.

This is the smallest linear combination possible. The proof is slightly funny but enjoyable.
sa+tb=gcd(a,b)

gcd(ka,kb)=i.ka+j.kb
          =k(ia+jb) # We need to prove ia+jb=gcd(a,b) ie. ia+jb is smallest linear combination of a and b
                    # How do we go about doing this?
                    # Will every linear combination be a multiple of gcd? Yes because gcd(a,b) will divide
                      any possible linear combination of a and b

          =k(i.gcd(a,b).m+j.gcd(a,b).n)
          =k.gcd(a,b)(im+jn)


gcd(ka,kb) = i.ka+j.kb which is the smallest possible combination of ka and kb. 

If we take k common from the above equation we get gcd(ka,kb) = k(ia+jb) = k.x.gcd(a,b)
# How can we argue that ia+jb is the smallest possible combination of a and b?
# As we know know that ia+jb is a multiple of the gcd we represent it as x.gcd(a,b)
# We need to prove that x=1


gdc(a,b) | ia+jb

******************************************************************************************************


3. If gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(a,c)=1, then gcd(a,bc)=1


gcd(a,b) so i.a+j.b=1  ---- 1
gcd(a,c) so m.a+n.c=1  ---- 2

multiplying 1 and 2

(i.a+j.b)(m.a+n.c)=1

(i.a.a.m+i.a.n.c+j.b.m.a+j.b.n.c)=1
a(iam+in+jbm)+bc(jn)=1

The above is a linear combination of a and bc which is equal to 1 therefore it is equal to gcd(a,bc)

******************************************************************************************************


4.If a | bc and gcd(a,b) = 1 then a | c

  gcd(a,b)=1 ie. pa+qb=1 thus pa+qb is equal to gcd(a,b).
  now a | bc ie bc=x.a

  # Didnt really understand the proof for this but we'll let it be for now because we have bigger fish to fry.


5. gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,rem(a,b))

  The above algorithm is called the euclid's algorithm and it is useful for quickly computing the gcd of large   numbers.

  # We will look into the proof of Euclid's algorithm tomorrow and will need a pen and paper or whiteboard.

  The text (being MIT text) assumes students will spend time proving things themselves rather then everything     being covered in the text and following these proofs makes us able to actually get into the habit of           proving and following slightly complex inductive proofs.
