Let's now work with some gcd.

The greatest common divisor of a and b os the largest number that divides both a and b.

The gcd turns out to be a very valuable piece of information about the relationship between a and b 
and for reasoning about integers in general.

Woahla!!

The gdc of a and b is the smallest possible linear combination of a and b!!!!

Which also means that there is no other linear combination of a and b which results in a smaller
integer value.

aX+bY>=gcd(a,b);

We need to prove the above statement.
