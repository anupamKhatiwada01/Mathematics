Let's now work with some gcd.

The greatest common divisor of a and b is the largest number that divides both a and b.

The gcd turns out to be a very valuable piece of information about the relationship between a and b 
and for reasoning about integers in general.

Woahla!!

The below statement is very profound.

The gdc of a and b is the smallest possible linear combination of a and b!!!!

Which also means that there is no other linear combination of a and b which results in a smaller
integer value.

aX+bY>=gcd(a,b);

We need to prove the above statement.


Linear Combinations of GCD

The below theorem is a very important theorem regarding the gcd of two numbers. This unlike most theorems should be remembered.

Theorem 4.2.1: The gcd(a,b)>= aX+bY, ie. the gcd of a and b is the smallest linear combination of a and b.

For eg the gcd(52,44) = 4 and sure enough 4 is the smallest linear combination of 52 and 44 because 6*52+(-7)*44 = 4.

We need to prove the above statement which is very intersting.


Proof of theorem 4.2.1: By the well ordering principle there is a smallest possible combination of a and b call it m.
We'll prove that m=gcd(a,b) by showing both gcd(a,b)<=m and m<=gcd(a,b)


First we'll show that gcd(a,b)<=m.
Let c be any common divisor of a and b such that c|a and c|b.
Therefore c|sa+tb for any s and t

a=k.c
sa= skc

b=l.c
tb=tlc

c|tlc+skc
c|c(tl+sk)

So there is some c which divides sa+tb for any s and t.

The gcd(a,b) is by definition a divisor of both a and b. So gcd(a,b) | sa+tb.
So gcd(a,b) | m as m|sa+tb
hence gcd(a,b)<=m

Now we show that m<=gcd(a,b)
We show this by showing that m | a.

A symmetric argument would show that m | b which means m is a common divisor of a and b.
All that remains is to show that m | a.

The core of our proof lies in showing that m | a.

By division "algorithm"

a=qm+r where 0<=r<m


m=sa+tb

a=q(sa+tb)+r

r=a-q(sa+tb)
r=a-qsa-qtb
r=a(1-qs)+(-qt)b

We just expressed r as a linear combination of a and b.
But m is the smallest linear combination of a and b and 0<=r<m.

As r cannot be smaller than m and positive that means that r=0. This implies m | a.



Corollary 4.2.2: An integer is a linear combination of a and b iff it is a multiple of gcd(a,b).
Proof: We have shown above that every linear combination of a and b is a multiple of gcd.
        Conversely since gcd(a,b) is a linear combination of a and b every multiple of gcd as well.
        gcd(a,b) = sa+tb
        k.gcd(a,b) = k.(sa+tb) = ks.a+kt.b ie every multiple of gcd is also a linear combination of a and b.
        

We can now restate the water jugs lemma in terms of gcd.

Corollary 4.2.3: Suppose we have water jugs with capacities a and b. Then the amout of water in the two jugs is a multiple of the gcd.

For example there is no way to form 4 gallons using 3 and 6 gallons because 4 is not a multiple of gcd(3,6)=3.
